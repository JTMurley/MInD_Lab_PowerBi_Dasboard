# MInD Lab PowerBi Dasboard

[![MInD Lab Dashboard Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VHGSAuSfsH4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHGSAuSfsH4 "MInD Lab Dashboard Video")

This dashboard was built within 2 days in order to track not only the Trello board progress of the MInD Lab team but also their work hours and justification of what they did in those specified hours. If you click the image above, you will be sent to the youtube video showcasing the dashboard and all of its abilities.

Furthermore, I have supplied the pbix file which you can view in the power bi desktop application, however the data wont be loaded as you wont have permission rights to access the root source of the data.
